# Not-So-Awesome Bing Search Bans and De-Indexing
A list of articles and resources about Bing Search blacklisting or de-indexing seemingly legitimate non-commercial blogs and websites.

## Introduction

Bing Search is the second most-used search engine in the world behind Google Search. While Google is the dominant search engine in almost every country in the world, Bing has added significance because a significant number of alternative search tools rely on Bing for indexing. Notable Bing-dependent search tools include DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Yahoo (and by extension MetaGer), and many more. For this reason, being a site  blocked by Bing from appearing in its search results or otherwise completely de-indexed may affect traffic beyond the direct loss of Bing referrals.

I am the webmaster of an online writing website called [*The New Leaf Journal*](https://thenewleafjournal.com). I use no ads, third-party scripts, or link-building schemes, and I publish original content. After having been Bing indexed continuously since 2020, we were blocked from appearing in Bing’s web search results on January 14, 2023, and completely de-indexed in March. The big loss for my project was DuckDuckGo traffic since DuckDuckGo was our second biggest search referrer behind Google (Bing was third). While the blocking/de-indexing and the lack of any support from Bing was and has been disappointing, it was not surprising. Before experiencing blocking/de-indexing,  I had written about the issue in January 2020 after reading about it happening to other independent blogs and writing sites.

I decided to create this repository to collect well-written accounts from around the web about Bing's sometimes-perplexing behavior. Before we move on to the links, I preface my list with a few notes:

* I am focusing on small, independent websites with original content that have had issues with Bing. I also prioritized sites that are light on (if not entirely absent of) ads, scripts, and tracking. I purposefully excluded sites that engaged in black hat SEO techniques, contain excessive advertising, or have other obvious issues which could cause problems with Bing or any other search engine.
* While I think that I have collected examples of Bing acting arbitrarily, I cannot say with certainty that any or all of the affected sites were free of serious issues. This is even true of my own site. I think that Bing is in the wrong for several reasons, including the fact that I had no issue with Bing for three years and that I have no issue with Google, Brave, Yandex, or Mojeek (Bing is the only problem). However, for all I know, there is some issue that I and everyone except Bing is missing.
* I put this list together as a resource for me and others.

### Other Webmaster resources

* [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)
* [Yandex Webmaster](https://webmaster.yandex.com/welcome/)  
Both Google and Yandex offer English webmaster tools. If you are having issues with Bing, you can check to see if Google and Yandex identify problems. In my case, I have no indexing issues with Google and Yandex, which led me to conclude that my problems are specific to Bing.

### My Story at *The New Leaf Journal*

I give myself first billing...

* [The Story of Our Bing Blacklisting](https://thenewleafjournal.com/the-story-of-our-bing-blacklisting/) (April 25, 2023)  
I discussed the circumstances behind our January 2023 Bing blacklisting and my initial efforts to diagnose and resolve the problem. The issue remains ongoing. I was inspired to write this post after seeing Mr. Dariusz Wieckiewicz's "Bing Jail" article on Hacker News (see below).

### Dariusz Wieckiewicz

1. [Bing Jail](https://dariusz.wieckiewicz.org/en/bing-jail/) (April 23, 2023)
2. [Escape from Bing Jail](https://dariusz.wieckiewicz.org/en/escape-from-bing-jail/) (Last updated May 1, 2023)  
The author's ad-free tech blog with original content was removed from Bing in January 2023 around the same time as *The New Leaf Journal*. He worked hard to diagnose the problem. He appears to have been re-indexed (see second post) after he made page 1 of Hacker News.

* [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35677086)  
According to the author, he saw movement toward a Bing revival within 48 hours of his first Bing Jail article making Hacker News page 1.

### Dave Rupert

1. [Shadow Banned by DuckDuckGo and Bing](https://daverupert.com/2023/01/shadow-banned-by-duckduckgo-and-bing/) (January 14, 2023)
2. [Updates on my Bing Ban](https://daverupert.com/2023/01/updates-on-my-bing-ban/) (January 18, 2023)
3. [My Bing Webmaster Guidelines Compliance Report](https://daverupert.com/2023/01/my-bing-webmaster-guidelines-compliance-report/) (January 19, 2023)
4. [Solved the Case of the Bing Ban Theory](https://daverupert.com/2023/02/solved-the-case-of-the-bing-ban-theory) (February 2, 2023) [Note: Great title]

These four articles go into great detail about the circumstances of his brief Bing ban and his efforts to resolve it. He also linked to several other independent ad-free tech writing blogs which suddenly had problems with Bing in January 2023. The author was advised by Bing that "[t]housands of small blogs were mistakenly marked as spam splogs," meaning that it sounds like Bing acknowledged that it had erred in this case. The author is more charitable to Bing than most of the accounts (including my own).

### Relja Novović of Bike Gremlin

* [Microsoft Bing - site gone from SERP overnight!](https://io.bikegremlin.com/28530/microsoft-bing-serp-gone-overnight/)  
An excellent, detailed post working through a peculiar Bing de-indexing saga from 2022. The author was active in investigating the problem and connecting with other webmasters who had similar issues. His site was removed from Bing search shortly after it was restored, but he appears to be in good standing based on his most recent update.
* [Comment on prod.uhrs.playmsn.com](https://io.bikegremlin.com/28530/microsoft-bing-serp-gone-overnight/#comment-520) (June 8, 2022)  
The comments section of the Bike Gremlin post is worth reading. One reader suggested that the blocks are triggered by employees working at Microsoft's click farm. I can confirm that I received referrals from prod.uhrs.playmsn.com after a couple of my support requests to Microsoft.

### The Cheapskate's Guide

* [**Microsoft De-indexed My Website from Bing but says It will re-index It Soon**](https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/deindexed-by-bing.html) (November 18, 2021)

This post inspired my first article on the subject of Bing de-indexing (see "Downstream Effect of Bing Bans" section). The Cheapskate's Guide is a minimalist site with original content. The post speculated that several articles not favorable to Microsoft caused the issue. It appears that the site was re-indexed but the issue was never identified.

### Jeff Johnson

* [Bing and DuckDuckGo removed my business web site](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/bing.html) (June 16, 2022)
* [Bing and DuckDuckGo removed my business web site AGAIN](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/bing2.html) (January 15, 2023)  
Note that the site on which the author wrote about the Bing ban is not the site which had the issue. You can see the site that was affected [here](https://underpassapp.com/) (note that the business site, which showcases the author's App Store apps, is very clean). It is not clear what caused the first or second de-indexing, but the issue appears to have resolved itself. Note that the second de-indexing occurred in January 2023.

### Jesse Squires

1. [My website disappeared from Bing and DuckDuckGo](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2022/03/25/my-website-disappeared-from-bing-and-duckduckgo/) (March 25, 2022)
2. [Part 2](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2022/07/25/my-website-disappeared-from-bing-and-duckduckgo-part-2/) (July 25, 2022)  
This blog was removed from Bing in March 2022. This prompted him to make a Bing webmaster account. Bing returned the site to the index after several months. The reason for the de-indexing and subsequent reversal will forever be a mystery.

### Dan of Nood SEO

* [Bing De-Indexed My Website! How I Got It Reindexed Again](https://noodseo.com/bing-de-indexed-my-website-how-i-got-it-reindexed-again/) (August 9, 2022)  
This site was de-indexed for about three months before suddenly being returned to the index. Mr. Dan speculated that his site was de-indexed because of several Amazon affiliate links on one of his pages.

### Michael Horowitz

* [Banned by Bing](https://www.michaelhorowitz.com/BannedByBing.php) (Last updated May 16, 2021)  
This site, which has original content, and no ads, tracking, or third-party scripts, was blacklisted by Bing in 2021. It appears some of its pages returned to Bing's index after several months. The author initially speculated the issue was related to content critical of Microsoft. In the final update, he speculated that Bing may have been missing the last updated date on some of his posts.

### David Aleksandersen

* [**Ctrl blog was unavailable in Bing Search for a month**](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/bing-delisted-canonicalization.html) (October 26, 2019)  
A well-written piece detailing a 2019 incident. The author had an additional problem because he was using Qwant for his site's search (Qwant relies heavily on Bing). The issue was resolved and the author speculated that removing some specific HTML attributes from his site's header fixed the issue.

### Nicolas Magand

* [Something is rotten in the state of Bing search](https://thejollyteapot.com/2022/10/28/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-bing-search) (October 28, 2022)  
The de-indexing story is not resolved in the post. Mr. Magand discussed some of the stories I linked to above and complained about Bing's lack of communication.

## Downstream effects of Bing bans

* [Importance of Bing Indexing For Alt Search](https://thenewleafjournal.com/importance-of-bing-indexing-for-alt-search/) (August 7, 2022) [written by me]  
Prompted by the excellent post by Cheapskate's guide, I wrote about how being de-indexed by Bing means losing referrals from Bing-derivatives such as DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Qwant, Yahoo, and MetaGer.
* [The Downstream Effects of Bing's Tiananmen Square Censorship](https://thenewleafjournal.com/the-downstream-effects-of-bings-tiananmen-square-censorship/) (June 6, 2021) [written by me]  
I discussed how Bing's decision to briefly block image results for certain queries pertaining to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre filtered down to Bing-dependent search front-ends. I specifically looked at DuckDuckGo, Qwant, and Swisscows. I also showed that Google-dependent search front-ends, notably Startpage, were unaffected.

### DuckDuckGo Tip

* [Comments from Gabriel Weinberg of DuckDuckGo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32361648)  
Mr. Gabriel Weinberg, the CEO of DuckDuckGo, suggested that webmasters blocked by Bing submit feedback through "Share Feedback" on a DuckDuckGo query where their site or articles are not being returned. However, I have not seen any examples of DuckDuckGo causing Bing to change a de-indexing decision.

It is interesting that this update occurred around the time many small blogs were de-indexed, but nothing in the article points to a specific nexus.

A post explaining how competitors can use spam backlings to cause Bing to de-index sites. None of the accounts I linked to appear to have been affected by this issue.

## Independent search engines

Bing is important in large part because many alternatives to the Google-Bing duopoly rely on Bing's index. For example, my site was hurt more by the loss of DuckDuckGo referrals than by the loss of Bing referrals (several webmasters in the above accounts noted the same issue). Many people who use alternatives such as DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Qwant, and the like are most likely not fully aware of their Bing dependence. While I hope that legitimate sites are fully indexed by both Google and Bing, we should also encourage smaller, genuinely independent search engine projects. Webmasters can play a key part in this by ensuring that their interesting articles and media are available to independent search engines. Below, I list some resources about independent search engines.

### Articles

* [A look at search engines with their own indexes](https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/03/10/search-engines-with-own-indexes/) (Last updated May 27, 2023) [Rohan Kumar]  
A terrific list about genuinely independent search engines with their own indexes and algorithms. The author includes notes about these search engines.
* [On whitelisting independent search crawlers](https://thenewleafjournal.com/whitelisting-independent-search-crawlers/) (April 6, 2023) [Me]  
I wrote this article encouraging webmasters to ensure that they are not blocking well-behaved bots from independent search crawlers.

### Tools and Resources
