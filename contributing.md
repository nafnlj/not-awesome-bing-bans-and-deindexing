1. You may make a pull request if you have any recommendations, corrections, or recommended links
2. If you are recommending a webmaster story, please make sure that the site at issue does not have obvious issues such as engaging in black hat SEO techniques, plagiarism, or excessive advertising and tracking (my focus is on small sites with original content being de-indexed by Bing)
3. If you are recommending a forum post, please try to provide a link to the relevant post instead of the entire discussion
4. If you are recommending a link, please include a brief explanation of why you think it should be added
5. You are welcome to add things that you have written or worked on
